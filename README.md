The idea behind git is that you maintain a repository locally. If you
wish you can synchronize with a remote repository server. It differs
from other SCM (source code management) systems in that there is a
staging area before committing where you add / remove items to be
committed before the actual commit. git is the command for use on your
local repository on your own computer. For windoze we recommend
<https://git-for-windows.github.io/> For Linux (possible MAC OSX) it
should be installed by default.

This repo is a set of instructions, not a standard repo. It is hosted
here as we are teaching the use of git local & remote.
